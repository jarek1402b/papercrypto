<font size="2">From antiquity people were trying to hide submitted messages. It was connected with attempts of passing key information, one of very first coding machines has its own origin in antique Greece, and their working principle was copying the diameter of a wooden stick, on which was wrapped ciphred message. In other words: only person who had the same diameter of the stick could read the encrypted message; those devices were called Skytale.</br></br>
However, incomparably the most famous coding machine in entire world's history is Enigma, which was used by many Axis' countries since 20's of XX century. It's encrypting method was broken in 1932 by Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski. The story of Enigma was always veiled in some sort of mythical fog, though its working principle was described in details and it's easy to find out for curious people.</br></br>
Each of described devices had it's own pros and cons, and also each ones coding method is already broken. In this case, is there any perfect encrypting method? A method in which coded message is not carrying any information about cipher code or the original message?</br>
The answer on both questions is "yes". Example of perfect cipher is that which code have at least the same length as encrypted message. To this cathegory we can count <b>One-Time Pad - OTP</b>.</font></br></br>
